# tidex6-indexer

Rebuilds the tidex6 Merkle tree from what is on chain, so a withdrawal can be
proved against a pool that other people have used.

`PoolIndexer::rebuild_tree` replays `tidex6-deposit:<leaf>:<commitment>:<root>`
program logs into a fresh offchain tree. No database, no indexer service, no
trusted third party holding the state — the chain is the state, and this crate
reads it.

That matters more than it sounds: it means a user can withdraw from a pool
without anyone's cooperation, including ours.

## Status

Live on Solana mainnet. The verifier program
[`CSDD31Zm…`](https://solscan.io/account/CSDD31Zmm3pRMHAMB8c3TBqsj9mbmH2rXBzV7jrsJhcd)
is immutable and OtterSec-verified; the pools and the reader registry are
verified and still upgradeable.

**Pre-audit.** The verifying key comes from a single-contributor trusted setup, so
proofs against it are forgeable by whoever ran that setup. A public ceremony is
live at [ceremony.tidex6.com](https://ceremony.tidex6.com) and needs
contributors — it takes a minute in a browser, spends nothing, and authorises no
payment. Until it finalises, do not use this to secure real funds.
